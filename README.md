# A Test Note Taking App Created Using Flutter

Pull requests will be denied if files are not named using the naming conventions which are listed in the app.

If changes are to be made to existing files of someone else's creation, precise explanations as to why must be provided.

When adding features and classes, always create new files. BloC states and events are exempt, but these files shall be limited to one abstract class per file.

## Known Bugs
[x] Notes are not being created.  
[ ] Notes are listed as though they are all the same note. See if you can find out why!  

## Future Features 

1. The default create note screen should include an interval timer that lasts for 25 minutes. 

2. The default home screen should only show notes that have been taken today and yesterday.

3. A hamburger menu that allows users see an archived list of their notes grouped by date.

4. The ability to set goals prior to beginning a note taking session. 
* This should be a separate button so as to not confuse users who simply want to jot down a quick note. *

5. Interval goals should be present but unchanging as the timer runs. 

6. Users should be able to add notes during the timer.

7. A break should occur after every interval, which has it's own section for notes.

8. Users who click the alternate note creation button should be given the option to start a 2, 4, 6, or 8 interval session. They should be prompted to create an overarching goal for the entire duration of all timers / breaks, as well as sub goals for each particular interval session.

9. Once all of the above have been implemented, the hamburger menu should have an advanced options setting which allows users to customize all aspects of interval session create (interval time, short break time, long break time, sounds that notify users when timers run out, the ability to grade oneself based on the success of the interval, the ability to edit notes after creating them, etc.)
